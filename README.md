# Mouse scartrace
Here you will find all information and code for downstream processing of mouse scartrace data. This includes transcriptome and scar analysis. Note that part of the pipeline has been moved to the [SingleCellMultiOmics](https://github.com/BuysDB/SingleCellMultiOmics) package!

Processing of scar libraries from fastq to count tables is now done using the [Scartrace data processing workflow](https://github.com/BuysDB/SingleCellMultiOmics/wiki/scartrace-data-processing).
Processing of transcriptome libraries from fastq to count tables is now done using the [Transcriptome data processing workflow](https://github.com/BuysDB/SingleCellMultiOmics/wiki/Transcriptome-data-processing).

Other dependencies:
- [IWSS clustering](https://github.com/BuysDB/IWSS). 
- Lineage trees are computed and visualised using the [Toverboom](https://github.com/BuysDB/ToverBoom) package.
