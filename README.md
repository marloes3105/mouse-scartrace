# Mouse scartrace
Here you will find all information and code for downstream processing of mouse scartrace data. This includes transcriptome and scar analysis. Note that part of the pipeline has been moved to the [SingleCellMultiOmics](https://github.com/BuysDB/SingleCellMultiOmics) package!

Processing of scar libraries from fastq to count tables is now done using the [Scartrace data processing workflow](https://github.com/BuysDB/SingleCellMultiOmics/wiki/scartrace-data-processing).
Processing of transcriptome libraries from fastq to count tables is now done using the [Transcriptome data processing workflow](https://github.com/BuysDB/SingleCellMultiOmics/wiki/Transcriptome-data-processing).

All jupyter notebooks for downstream analysis can be found in this repository in the 'transcriptome' and 'scars' folders. 

An explanation on how to use the notebooks in this repository can be found in the wiki.
